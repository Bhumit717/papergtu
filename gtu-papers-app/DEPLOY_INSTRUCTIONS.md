# Deployment Instructions

## 1. Cloudflare R2 Setup (Papers Storage)
Since you have ~36,000 papers, we will host them on Cloudflare R2 instead of Vercel.

1.  **Get Credentials**:
    *   Log in to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
    *   Go to **R2** from the sidebar.
    *   Click **Manage R2 API Tokens** (top right).
    *   Click **Create API token**.
    *   Select **Admin Read & Write** permission.
    *   Copy the `Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key`, and your `Account ID`.

2.  **Configure Environment**:
    *   Open `.env.example` in `gtu-papers-app`.
    *   Save it as `.env`.
    *   Fill in your R2 credentials.
    *   Set `R2_BUCKET_NAME` to `gtu-papers` (or your preferred name).

3.  **Upload Papers**:
    *   Run the upload script to sync papers and update metadata:
    ```bash
    cd gtu-papers-app
    node scripts/upload-r2.js
    ```
    *   This will upload all papers and generate `public/papers_metadata.json` with the correct cloud URLs.

## 2. GitHub & Vercel (Website Deployment)
Now that the papers are "in the cloud" and the metadata is updated, we deploy the site.

1.  **Deploy to Vercel**:
    ```bash
    cd gtu-papers-app
    vercel deploy --prod
    ```

2.  **Push to GitHub**:
    *   Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `gtu-papers-app`).
    *   Run these commands:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gtu-papers-app.git
    git push -u origin master
    ```

## Notes
- The local `papers` folder is ignored by Git to avoid upload limits.
- The `public/papers` folder is also ignored.
- The app will fetch metadata from the file generated by the upload script.
